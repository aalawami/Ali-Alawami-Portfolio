        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Senior in Computer Science with minors in Game Design and in Digital Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
            My academic interests lie in the intersection of technology and people, specifically in the areas of Human Computer Interaction, UX design, front end development, and web development.</p>
        <p>Last summer, I had the privilege of participating in the KAUST Summer Internship Program, 
            where I conducted research on network security and vulnerabilities in online games. This experience solidified my passion for exploring the ways in which technology can be used to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>As I approach graduation, I am excited to begin exploring career opportunities that will allow me to use my skills to create user-friendly, intuitive technology. 
            If you are interested in connecting or learning more about my experience and skills, please feel free to reach out></p>
